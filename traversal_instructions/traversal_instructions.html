<div id="introduction" class="section scrollspy">
<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>
	<em>Traversal</em> is a game with a simple objective: navigate your player
	safely across the board onto the green target without touching any of the
	"dangerous" pieces.
</p>

<p>
	Please make time to read this page carefully, and to follow the
	instructions exactly. If you fail to comply with some instruction here, you
	will be penalized.
</p>
</div>

<!-- ======================================================================= -->
<div id="rules" class="section scrollspy">
<h2>The rules of the game</h2>

<p>
	Traversal is played on a rectangular board divided into squares.  Some of
	the squares are empty, while others contain "active" pieces.
</p>

<table>
	<tbody><tr>
		<td width="10%"><img src="./traversal_instructions_files/tvl_e.png" height="54px"></td>
		<td>Empty square</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><img src="./traversal_instructions_files/tvl_x.png" height="54px"></td>
		<td>Wall, never moves</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><img src="./traversal_instructions_files/tvl_s.png" height="54px"></td>
		<td>Player, moved by the user (keys on the keyboard)</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><img src="./traversal_instructions_files/tvl_t.png" height="54px"></td>
		<td>Target, never moves</td>
	</tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>
	If the player is at the left (or right) edge of the board, moving left (or
	right) off the board has no effect.  In other words, the player cannot move
	beyond the left and right edge of the board.
	On the other hand, if the player is at the top (or bottom) edge of the
	board, moving up (or down) makes the player appear at the other edge.  In
	other words, the player can wrap around the board from the top to the
	bottom and vice versa.
</p>

<h3>Movers</h3>

<p>
	Movers are active pieces that move around when the player moves.
	Horizontal movers move one position every time the player makes a horizontal
	move (either left or right); vertical movers move one position every time
	the player makes a vertical move (either up or down).  There are four kinds
	of horizontal movers, and four corresponding kinds of vertical movers.
</p>

<table>
	<tbody><tr>
		<td width="10%"><img src="./traversal_instructions_files/tvl_dh.png" height="54px"></td>
		<td width="10%"><img src="./traversal_instructions_files/tvl_dv.png" height="54px"></td>
		<td>Horizontal and vertical down movers</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td width="10%"><img src="./traversal_instructions_files/tvl_uh.png" height="54px"></td>
		<td width="10%"><img src="./traversal_instructions_files/tvl_uv.png" height="54px"></td>
		<td>Horizontal and vertical up movers</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td width="10%"><img src="./traversal_instructions_files/tvl_lh.png" height="54px"></td>
		<td width="10%"><img src="./traversal_instructions_files/tvl_lv.png" height="54px"></td>
		<td>Horizontal and vertical left movers</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td width="10%"><img src="./traversal_instructions_files/tvl_rh.png" height="54px"></td>
		<td width="10%"><img src="./traversal_instructions_files/tvl_rv.png" height="54px"></td>
		<td>Horizontal and vertical right movers</td>
	</tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>
	Like the player, movers can "wrap-around" the board out the top and in the
	bottom, and vice versa.  <em>Unlike</em> the player, movers can also
	wrap-around from left to right and vice versa.  Movers can move over any
	other non-empty pieces (including other movers) without affecting them.
	This includes the target.  If the player moves onto the target while there
	is also a mover on the target, the player still wins the game.
</p>

<h3>Switchers</h3>

<p>
	Switchers are active pieces that are either on or off.  When they are on,
	the player is not allowed to move onto them; "touching" them will end the
	round.  When they are off, the player can move over switchers.  Switchers
	toggle between the on/off states based whenever the player moves.
	Horizontal switchers toggle every time the player makes a horizontal move
	(either left or right); vertical switchers toggle every time the player
	makes a vertical move (either up or down).
</p>

<table>
	<tbody><tr>
		<td width="10%"><img src="./traversal_instructions_files/tvl_sh1.png" height="54px"></td>
		<td width="10%"><img src="./traversal_instructions_files/tvl_sv1.png" height="54px"></td>
		<td>Horizontal and vertical switchers in on state</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td width="10%"><img src="./traversal_instructions_files/tvl_sh0.png" height="54px"></td>
		<td width="10%"><img src="./traversal_instructions_files/tvl_sv0.png" height="54px"></td>
		<td>Horizontal and vertical switchers in off state</td>
	</tr>
</tbody></table>

<h3>Keys and ports</h3>

<p>
	Ports are active pieces that are either open or closed.  Keys are also
	active pieces.  At the start of a round, all keys are "available":  when
	the player moves over a key, it toggles all of the ports on the board
	between their open/closed states.  In other words, all ports that are open,
	change to closed; all ports that are closed, change to open.  Once a key has
	toggled the ports, the key becomes unavailable and can never toggle the
	ports again.  The player is not allowed to move onto closed ports;
	"touching" them will end the round.  The player <em>can</em> move onto open
	ports.
</p>


<table>
	<tbody><tr>
		<td width="10%"><img src="./traversal_instructions_files/tvl_p1.png" height="54px"></td>
		<td>Closed port</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td width="10%"><img src="./traversal_instructions_files/tvl_p0.png" height="54px"></td>
		<td>Open port</td>

	<tr>
		<td width="10%"><img src="./traversal_instructions_files/tvl_k0.png" height="54px"></td>
		<td>Unavailable key</td>
	</tr>
</tbody></table>

</div>


<h3>Walls</h3>
	Walls remain stationary, "touching" them will end the round.

<h2>File and output formats</h2>

<p>
This section describes the format of board files, moves files, and the text
output of the board.  Your program must follow these formats precisely: the
tests will use the formats and if your program does not implement them, it
will fail the tests.
</p>

<h3>Board file format</h3>

<ul class="old">

<li>
The first line of the file is a string.  This is the title of board.
Your program must read this line, but it may ignore it further.
</li>

<li>
The second line of the file describes the first of the board.  It contains
two integers, <em>R</em> and <em>C</em>, separated by a single space.
The board will contain <em>R</em> rows and <em>C</em> columns.
It is given that <em>3 ≤ R ≤ 15</em> and <em>3 ≤ C ≤ 15</em>.
Both integers start with a non-zero digit.
The line contains nothing else.
</li>

<li>
The next <em>R</em> lines contains exactly <em>C</em> characters each.
Each character denotes the contain of one cell of the board.

<ul class="old">

<li>
A "<code>.</code>" character denotes an empty cell.
</li>

<li>
A "<code>s</code>" (lowercase) or "<code>S</code>" (uppercase)
character denotes the starting position of the player.
Each file will contain a single "<code>s</code>"/"<code>S</code>"
character.
</li>

<li>
A "<code>t</code>" (lowercase) or "<code>T</code>" (uppercase)
character denotes the position of the target.
Each file will contain a single "<code>t</code>"/"<code>T</code>"
character.
</li>

<li>
A "<code>x</code>" (lowercase) or "<code>X</code>" (uppercase)
character denotes a wall.
</li>

<li>
A "<code>u</code>" (lowercase) character denotes a horizontal mover that moves up.
</li>

<li>
A "<code>d</code>" (lowercase) character denotes a horizontal mover that moves down.
</li>

<li>
A "<code>l</code>" (lowercase) character denotes a horizontal mover that moves left.
</li>

<li>
A "<code>r</code>" (lowercase) character denotes a horizontal mover that moves right.
</li>

<li>
A "<code>U</code>" (uppercase) character denotes a vertical mover that moves up.
</li>

<li>
A "<code>D</code>" (uppercase) character denotes a vertical mover that moves down.
</li>

<li>
A "<code>L</code>" (uppercase) character denotes a vertical mover that moves left.
</li>

<li>
A "<code>R</code>" (uppercase) character denotes a vertical mover that moves right.
</li>

<li>
A "<code>h</code>" (lowercase) character denotes a closed horizontal switch.
</li>

<li>
A "<code>H</code>" (uppercase) character denotes an open horizontal switch.
</li>

<li>
A "<code>v</code>" (lowercase) character denotes a closed vertical switch.
</li>

<li>
A "<code>V</code>" (uppercase) character denotes an open vertical switch.

A "<code>k</code>" (lowercase) or "<code>K</code>" (uppercase)
character denotes a key.
</li>

<li>
A "<code>p</code>" (lowercase) character denotes a closed port.
</li>

<li>
A "<code>P</code>" (uppercase) character denotes an open port.
</li>

</ul>

</li>

<li>
The file does not contain anything else.
</li>

</ul>

<p>
Here is an example of a board file:
</p>

<pre class="shell">First moves
3 10
.U...UxU..
sUDxDUxUDt
..DxD...D.
</pre>

<h3>Moves file format</h3>

<ul class="old">

<li>
The file contains a single line.
</li>

<li>
The line contains a sequence of five action characters but may also contain
"illegal" characters.
</li>

<li>
The "<code>h</code>" (lowercase) character denotes a left move.
</li>

<li>
The "<code>l</code>" (lowercase) character denotes a right move.
</li>

</pre>

<h3>Command-line output format</h3>

<ul class="old">

<li>
The output is similar <em>but not identical</em> to the board file.
</li>

<li>
The output either starts with the first line of the board, or, if a message
must be printed according to the requirements (either
"<code>Incorrect move</code>",
"<code>You lost!</code>", or
"<code>You won!</code>".
</li>

<li>
The output contains one line for each row of the board.  The rows appear
in the same order as in the board file.
</li>

<li>
Each line contains one character for each column of the board.  The character
depends on the contains of the corresponding cell of the board:

<ul class="old">

<li>
A "<code>.</code>" character denotes an empty cell.
</li>

<li>
A "<code>t</code>" character denotes the target.
</li>

<li>
An "<code>x</code>" character denotes a wall.
</li>

<li>
A "<code>k</code>" character denotes a key.
</li>

<li>
A lowercase "<code>p</code>" character denotes a closed port.
</li>

<li>
An uppercase "<code>P</code>" character denotes an open port.
</li>

<li>
A lowercase "<code>s</code>" character denotes a closed switch.
</li>

<li>
An uppercase "<code>S</code>" character denotes an open switch.
</li>

<li>
An "<code>m</code>" character denotes a mover (of any kind).
</li>

<li>
A "<code>Y</code>" character denotes the player.
</li>

</ul></li>

<li>
A cell may contains several pieces.  For example, a cell may contain
a wall ("<code>x</code>"),
a mover ("<code>m</code>"), and
the player ("<code>Y</code>").  In this case, the output must contain
<span class="hl">only</span> the last character on the list above.  In this
example, it will be "<code>Y</code>".
</li>

<li>
The output does not contain anything else.
</li>

</ul>

<p>
Here is an example of the command-line output:
</p>

<pre class="shell">You lost!
Yxxx...xxx
..x..x.x.t
x...xx...x
</pre>

<h2>Hand-in and demonstration</h2>
<p>
When you are done, create a ZIP file that contains:
</p>

<ul class="old">
<li>A single <code>.java</code> file with your project's code. This java file MUST
be named in the format SU&lt;student number&gt;. Example: SU12345678</li>
<li>Resource files required for your program to work such as images and/or
audio files.</li>
<li>Include, in your root directory, the .java files (from stdlib) that your program uses to run. This is necessary
because your program is expected to compile and run as soon as it is pulled from sunLearn, no additional file
additions/alterations should be necessary.</li>
<li>Your zip file MUST use your student number as name. Example: 12345678.zip</li>
<li>An example submission format is shown in the image below (the files must of course be zipped as described above):
	<br>
<img src="./traversal_instructions_files/submission_format.png" alt="submission format">

</li>

</ul>

<p>
How to submit your zip file:
</p>
<ul class="old">
<li>To submit your ZIP file, log in to learn.sun.ac.za.</li>
<li>Project submissions will open on sunLearn 1 week before the due date</li>
<li>The first project submission will open at midnight on the 27th of April and will close at midnight on the 4th of May </li>
<li>The final project submission will open at midnight on the [TBA] and will close at midnight on the [TBA]</li>
<li>You are allowed to submit multiple times.  It is a good idea to submit
early, even before you are done, in case anything happens to the system or to
your code.</li>
<li>Test your ZIP file before you submit: extract the files in a clean
directory and make sure that it compiles and runs correctly.</li>
<li>If you write your program on a home laptop or PC, be sure to test
	that your program compiles and runs correctly on the NARGA computers to prevent
	unwanted issues during your demo.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Object Oriented Programming (OOP) will not be allowed for this project. Your project must be written in a single java file.
</p>
<p>
Your ZIP file must <em>NOT</em> contain any <code>.class</code> files.  You
will be required to compile the project during the demonstration <em>FROM THE
COMMAND LINE</em>.  In other words, you are free to develop your project in an
IDE such as Eclipse or NetBeans, but you must be able to compile and run it
from the command-line.  If you are not able to do this, don't use an IDE.
</p>

<h3>Demonstrations</h3>
<p>There will be two submissions for the project. The first will be marked and feedback given but this submission is for formative purposes only,
	 the final submission and demo will make up the full project mark.</p>

<h5>First Project Handin Submission</h5>
<li>Students will receive a feedback report and mark once the demis have marked their submission. This mark is for formative purposes ONLY,
it will not count towards your final project mark.</li>
<!-- <li><b>rw114 students</b> will demo their first project submission on either <b>Tuesday the 14th April</b> or <b>Thursday the
	 16th of April</b>, during the student's allocated tutorial period. The Tuesday tutorial period is 10:00-13:00 in Narga A. The Thursday
	 tutorial period is 14:00-17:00 in Narga A or D.</li>
<li><b>rw113 students</b> will demo their first project submission on <b>Thursday the
	 9th of April</b> during the allocated tutorial period. The tutorial period is 14:00–17:00 in NEELSIE E01.1.</li> -->

<h5>Final Project Handin Submission/Demo</h5>
<li>This hand-in will be graded by a live demo, details TBA</li>
<!-- <li><b>rw114 students</b> will demo their final project submission on either <b>Tuesday the 5th of May</b> or <b>Thursday the
	 7th of May</b>, during the student's allocated tutorial period. The Tuesday tutorial period is 10:00-13:00 in Narga A. The Thursday

<li>The demonstrations are like examinations, it is essential that you keep the date open for the entire tutorial
period. The demonstration dates, times and locations have been released with plently time to diarise the date and keep it open,
no requests to alter student's demo slots will be accommodated for. It is the student's own responsibility to be at the correct location
during their demo slot.</li>
<!--
<ul class="old">

<li>Demonstration times are strict.  Make sure that you are at the lab <span class="hl">ten minutes</span> before your scheduled time.</li>

<li>Stay <span class="hl">outside</span> the lab until <span class="hl">one
minute</span> before your scheduled time.</li>

</ul>
-->
<p>



Demonstrations follow the steps below:
</p>

<ol>

<li>Your handed-in project is downloaded from learn.sun.ac.za.</li>

<li>You are asked to compile your project from the command-line.</li>

<li>Your marker may run several tests on your program in text mode and/or run your program
	in graphics mode to check visually that it satisfies the requirements.</li>

<li>Your marker will inspect your code and check that it satisfies the coding
conventions.</li>

<li>Your marker will ask you to explain certain parts of your code and make
changes to ensure that you wrote the code yourself.</li>

<li>You will be given a chance to query the allocation of marks that you received.
If issues of mark allocation are not raised in the demo, the mark will
not be changed thereafter. </li>

</ol>

Projects flagged for plagiarism will be given a mark of zero and the student will be
dealt with according to Stellenbosch University's plagiarism policy.

<h2>Coding Conventions</h2>

<p>
It is important to stick to sensible coding conventions.
</p>

<ol>

<li><p>
<strong>Be consistent.</strong>  Whatever conventions you choose to use, be
consistent.  If you deviate from your coding conventions, you will be
penalized.
</p></li>

<li><p>
<strong>Indent.</strong>  Indent consistently and neatly.
</p></li>

<li><p>
<strong>Choose sensible names.</strong>  Variables should be named sensibly.
This does not mean that all names have to be long and descriptive:  under some
circumstances, short one-letter names are more appropriate that long names.
Static methods must <em>always</em> have descriptive names.
</p></li>

<li><p>
<strong>Comment sensibly.</strong>  Not everything needs to be commented to
death, but there should be enough comments (in the right places) so that
someone else can read and understand your code.
</p></li>

		To use the sample board, move, and output files, download and unzip
		the sample files given above.  For each of the sample files, run your program in text
