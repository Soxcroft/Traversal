# Traversal
My first Java project. Implements the instructions in traversal_instructions/project_spec.html. It also includes a bonus feature which allows you to toggle the auto-player by pressing 'a' and let the computer try get you out of sticky situations. It is based on a heuristic approach though, so it might not always work.

The bash scripts, test1.sh and test2.sh, compare the program's output with the expected output. test1.sh was for the first submission and test2.sh was for the second.

This project makes use of some of the programs in Princeton's Introduction to Programming in Java's standard library. The library can be found at: https://introcs.cs.princeton.edu/java/stdlib/

The samples, pictures and project instructions were provided by Stelenbosch University.
